# Computer Simulations of Sensory Systems

Selection of projects developed for the ETH Zurich course with Thomas Haslwanter. 

## Sensory Systems
1. The **Visual** System - build a retinal implant
2. The **Vestibular** System - build a vestibular implant
3. The **Auditory** System - build a cochlear implant

## File decriptions
The three simulations can be found in their own individual folders:
1. Run with `visual.py`, see file for usage instructions 
  * includes sample image data for processing in the `Images` folder
2. Run with `vestibular.py`
  * includes sample movement data in the `MovementData` folder
3. Run with `auditory.py`
  * includes `GammaTones.py` needed to apply Gamma Tone filter to input data
  * includes sample sound data in the `sounds` folder

## Authorship
The code and ideas were developed in team brainstorming sessions with Moritz Gruber and Patrick Haller
